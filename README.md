Our team has successfully created a web application for online event management perposes. 
The main objective of the project was to make easy the process of creating and publishing certain events 
for event managers/organizers and let people around the world reserve tickets to attend these events effortlessly.

Our system allows event managers to create new events, issue tickets for open events, remove or update events. 
And it also allows event attendees to view new events with details, book event tickets, cancel or update bookings
